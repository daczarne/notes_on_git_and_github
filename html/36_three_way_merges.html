          <p>To see how three-way merges work first, we'll create a new branch called <span class="git-aqua">new-feature</span> and create a new file there called <em>main.js</em>. After staging and committing <em>main.js</em> we switch back to <span class="git-aqua">master</span>. Here we'll update <em>toc.txt</em> and again, we'll stage and commit the changes.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Now we are in the situation described in the three-way merge scenario. Our target branch (in this case <span class="git-aqua">master</span>) is one commit ahead of the commit it was when we created the objective branch (in this case <span class="git-aqua">new-feature</span>). Thus, Git can't just move the <span class="inline-code">master</span> pointer to the tip of the <span class="git-aqua">new-feature</span> branch because there's a commit in <span class="git-aqua">master</span> that cannot be reached from <span class="git-aqua">new-feature</span>.</p>
          <br>
          <p>To run a three-way merge we proceed as before and start by switching into the <span class="git-aqua">master</span> branch. Now we run</p>
          <div class="code">
            <code>git merge new-feature</code>
          </div>
          <p>VS Code will be launched where we can edit our commit message (if necessary). When we close it, Git will conclude the merge process.</p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="left-col">
          <img src="../assets/img/tw-merge-2.png" alt="" class="git-bash-img">
        </div>
        <div class="right-col">
          <p>We can see out merges in the <span class="inline-code">log</span> more clearly by using the <span class="inline-code">--graph</span> option</p>
          <div class="code">
            <code>git log --oneline --all --graph -10</code>
          </div>
          <p>Starting from the bottom and moving up, the first merge we see is the fast-forward merge from the now-deleted <span class="git-green">bugfix</span> branch onto <span class="git-green">master</span>. This branch was created from commit <em>d106b04</em>. On it, we created commit <em>e6614d7</em>. Because at the time of merge <span class="git-green">master</span> was still at commit <em>d106b04</em> and we used a <span class="inline-code">--no-ff</span> option, the merge commit <em>4188bbb</em> was created. Git shows this merge as a triangle where each commit is a vertice.</p>
          <br>
          <p>On the other hand, for our three-way merge, Git is displaying a trapezoid, since there's a commit on <span class="git-green">master</span> (<em>2aa25c1</em>) that was created after the <span class="git-green">new-feature</span> branch was created. Both branches merged at commit <em>9a4b466</em>.</p>
