              Suppose our project looks like the one on the right and we found a
              bug we didn't know existed or what caused it. We could check every
              single commit one-by-one until we find it, but that is
              time-consuming. <span class="inline-code">bisect</span> is a Git
              tool for finding bugs in our code.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              In a nutshell, it works by doing a binary search though-out our
              repository. We'll tell Git of a <em>good</em> commit, and a
              <em>bad</em> commit and Git will help us zero-in the commit that
              caused the bug so that we can fix it.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="right-col">
            <img src="../assets/img/bisect-1.png" alt="" class="git-bash-img" />
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="left-col">
            <p>
              So, imagine <em>8eec1d2</em> (our
              <span class="inline-code">HEAD</span>) is a bad commit (we found a
              bug here), and <em>ca49180</em> (our initial commit) will be our
              first good commit (a commit that we know did not have the issue).
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              To start <span class="inline-code">bisect</span> we simply run
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git bisect start</code>
            </div>
            <p>
              Notice that Git Bash changed from
              <span class="git-aqua">(master)</span> to
              <span class="git-aqua">(master | BISECTING)</span>. Right now our
              <span class="inline-code">HEAD</span> is at the bad commit (the
              last one), so we need to tell Git that this is a bad commit. To do
              that, we run
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git bisect bad</code>
            </div>
            <p>
              Now we need to give Git a good commit. If you didn't write down
              the hash for a good commit before starting the
              <span class="inline-code">bisect</span> process don't worry, you
              can run <span class="inline-code">git log --oneline</span> and get
              it now. So we run
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git bisect good ca49180</code>
            </div>
            <p>
              Now Git is telling us that we have 7 revisions left (7 commits to
              check instead of the total 16), and it's also telling us that we
              can get it done in 3 steps. Notice that Git Bash changed again and
              is not at commit <em>24e86ee</em>.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="right-col">
            <img src="../assets/img/bisect-2.png" alt="" class="git-bash-img" />
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="single-col">
            <p>
              If we now run
              <span class="inline-code">git log --oneline --all</span> we see
              that <span class="git-green">master</span> is at the top and it's
              referenced as a bad commit. At the bottom of the log, we see that
              there's a second reference for our bad commit. Our
              <span class="git-aqua">HEAD</span> is at commit <em>24e86ee</em>.
              This means that our working directory has been restored to this
              point in time. Therefore, we can test and see if the bug is here
              already. If it is, that means that the bug was introduced
              somewhere between <em>ca49180</em> and
              <span class="git-aqua">HEAD</span>. If it is not, then the bug was
              introduced somewhere between
              <span class="git-aqua">HEAD</span> and
              <span class="git-green">master</span>. Either way, we eliminated
              half of all possible commits in one try.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>For this demo, let's tell Git that this is a good commit</p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git bisect good</code>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="left-col">
            <img src="../assets/img/bisect-3.png" alt="" class="git-bash-img" />
          </div>
          <div class="right-col">
            <p>
              Now Git is telling us that there are 3 revisions left and that it
              will take 2 steps to inspect them. Our
              <span class="git-aqua">HEAD</span> has now moved to commit
              <em>50db987</em>. If we look at the log again, we see that it has
              moved up. Our repository has once again been checked out to this
              commit. So we can test our application here and see if the bug is
              there or not. Again for this demo, we'll tell Git that this is a
              good commit. So again we run
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git bisect good</code>
            </div>
            <p>
              And we'll do it one more time so that it moves to the commit prior
              to <span class="git-green">master</span>.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="left-col">
            <p>
              Now we are at commit <em>e22efe7</em> and suppose that we found
              the bug here. We'll tell Git that this is a bad commit
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git bisect bad</code>
            </div>
            <p>
              Now Git knows which one was the first bad commit and it's giving
              us all the information about that commit: author, date, a summary
              of changes.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Now we can inspect and test our code here and find the bug. Once
              we know how to fix it, we can move our
              <span class="inline-code">HEAD</span> back to
              <span class="inline-code">master</span> and implement the fix.
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git bisect reset</code>
            </div>
          </div>
