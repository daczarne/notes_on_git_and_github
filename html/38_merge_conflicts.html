            <p>
              When merging branches, three different types of conflicts may
              arise
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The same line of code was changed in different ways in the two
                merging branches.
              </li>
              <li>
                A file was changed in one branch but deleted in the other
                branch.
              </li>
              <li>
                The same file is added in different branches, but the content of
                the file is different in the different branches.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Whenever there's a conflict Git will not know how to merge the
              branches and it's going to ask us to solve the conflicts manually
              before staging and committing the merge.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="example"></div>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="left-col">
            <p>
              To see an example of the first scenario first, let's create a new
              branch called <span class="git-aqua">bugfix</span> and change the
              <em>toc.txt</em> file. In this file, we'll delete all its content
              and on the first line write <em>Changes from bugfix branch</em>.
              Now stage it and commit it.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Next, we'll switch back to <span class="git-aqua">master</span>.
              Open the <em>toc.txt</em> file. Delete all its content, and in the
              first row write <em>Changes from master branch</em>. Stage it.
              Commit it.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>Now we'll run</p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git merge bugfix</code>
            </div>
            <p>
              Now Git is telling us that there is a conflict and that the
              automatic merge process failed. Notice that Git Bash has changed
              from <span class="git-aqua">master</span> to
              <span class="git-aqua">master|MERGING</span>. This tells us that
              Git is in the middle of a merging process.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="right-col">
            <img
              src="../assets/img/merge-conflicts-1.png"
              alt=""
              class="git-bash-img"
            />
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="left-col">
            <img
              src="../assets/img/merge-conflicts-2.png"
              alt=""
              class="git-bash-img"
            />
          </div>
          <div class="right-col">
            <p>First, let's run</p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git status</code>
            </div>
            <p>
              Here we can see where the merge conflict is under the unmerged
              paths. Git is telling us that both branches have changes to
              <em>toc.txt</em>. So let's open <em>toc.txt</em> in VS Code by
              running
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>code toc.txt</code>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="left-col">
            <p>
              In the image to the right is what you'll see in VS Code. What we
              see are markers that represent the changes in the current branch
              (green) and the changes in the other branch (blue). In between
              them there's a divider marked by equal signs, <em>=======</em>.
              This syntax will be repeated through-out the file as many times as
              there are conflicts.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="right-col">
            <img
              src="../assets/img/merge-conflicts-3.png"
              alt=""
              class="vscode-img"
              id="vscode-merge-conflict"
            />
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="left-col">
            <img
              src="../assets/img/merge-conflicts-4.png"
              alt=""
              class="vscode-img"
            />
          </div>
          <div class="right-col">
            <p>
              On top of the <span class="git-green">HEAD</span> marker, there
              are three buttons. We need to choose one. If we select
              <em>Accept Current Change</em> then the changes from the current
              branch will be kept and the incoming ones will be discarded. If
              the select <em>Accept Incoming Changes</em> the incoming changes
              will be kept and the current ones will be discarded. If we select
              <em>Accept Both Changes</em> then both changes will be kept, in
              the order in which VS Code is showing them.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              For this demo, I'll go with <em>Accept Both Changes</em> and the
              file will change to what you see on the image to the left.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="single-col">
            <p>
              Three brief comments before we move on. There's a fourth button
              that reads <em>Compare Changes</em>. If you click on it, VS Code
              will open the file in diff mode (that is, showing the changes side
              by side).
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              If you selected an option and wish to change it, even if you have
              already saved it, just press Ctrl + z (undo). Git will not
              continue with the merge process until we manually create a merge
              commit.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              You can always edit the file by hand. To do so, you'll need to
              remove the markers and the separation. Try not to include new
              changes on the merge commit (that is, new code or new lines of any
              sort). But sometimes this is not possible because of the kind of
              merge conflict that we are faced with. We refer to merge commits
              that add new code as <em>evil commits</em>.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="left-col">
            <p>
              Now that we have resolved all merge conflicts, we can stage our
              changes with <span class="inline-code">git add toc.txt</span>. If
              we run
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git status</code>
            </div>
            <p>
              we'll see that now there are no more unmerged paths. Therefore,
              there are no more changes. At this point, we can commit our
              changes. Since this is a merge commit, we will not introduce a
              commit message. So we run
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git commit</code>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="right-col">
            <img
              src="../assets/img/merge-conflicts-5.png"
              alt=""
              class="git-bash-img"
            />
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="single-col">
            <p>
              Because we didn't provide a commit message, Git will open VS Code.
              In general, we accept the default short-message but add a
              description explaining how the merge conflicts were resolved. Once
              done, we save our changes and close VS Code. Now Git will complete
              the merge process. You can see that Git Bash has changed from
              <span class="git-aqua">master|MERGING</span> to
              <span class="git-aqua">master</span>.
