              Sometimes we do a merge and realize that our program stopped
              working and we want to undo it. Here we have two options: 1)
              undoing the commit as if it had never been there (called
              resetting), 2) create a new commit that cancels out all the
              changes in our merge commit (called reverting).
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              When resetting we have to be very careful because we are
              re-writing history. If the changes only exist on our local
              repository that is OK. But if we have already shared the changes
              with the rest of our team we should
              <span class="here">NEVER</span> re-write history.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The diagrams below explain the two situations. In both of them, we
              begin from the same starting point: a merger commit has taken
              place, merging a branch called
              <span class="git-aqua">new-feature</span> into
              <span class="git-aqua">master</span>. The difference is that when
              we use <em>reset</em> we move the
              <span class="git-green">master</span> pointer back to its parent
              commit (the commit with a red border that is before the merge
              commit, and in the <span class="git-green">master</span> branch).
              Because there are now no commits or pointers pointing to our
              merger commit, Git will <em>Garbage Collect</em> this commit and
              throw it away.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              On the other hand, when we use a <em>revert</em> we are creating a
              new commit that comes after the merge commit, and moving the
              <span class="git-green">HEAD</span> pointer onto this new commit
              (shown in blue with white border on the diagram). This commit
              makes all the opposite changes as those that were done on the
              merge commit. One thing to consider when reverting mergers is that
              the merge commit actually has two parent commits: one on
              <span class="git-green">master</span> and one on
              <span class="git-green">new-feature</span>. We'll have to specify
              Git which commit to revert to and, since we'll do it from the
              <span class="git-green">master</span> branch (because it's the
              branch that was modified with the merger), we'll revert to the
              parent commit on this branch.

              Before we start with an example, let's take a look at our log.
              We'll do both operations on commit <em>3a485a4</em>, which is our
              last merge commit. Before starting an operation like this, it's
              always recommended that you write down the ID for the commit you
              are going to revert or reset. You can delete it once done.
            </p>
          </div>

            <p>
              We'll start with the <em>reset</em> option. But before we do we
              need to clarify some terminology. The
              <span class="inline-code">git reset</span> command has three
              options:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span class="inline-code">--soft</span>: Git will have our
                repository point to a different commit, but our index and
                working tree will not be affected.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="inline-code">--mixed</span>: Git will take the new
                snapshot and put it in the index as well. This is the default
                option so we don't need to specify it.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="inline-code">--hard</span>: Git will take the new
                snapshot and copy it to both the index and the working tree.
                This means that all environments will look the same. It also
                means that all local changes in our working-tree will be lost,
                so make sure to stash them before resetting.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">

              We can see that both <span class="git-aqua">HEAD</span> and
              <span class="git-green">master</span> are now at commit
              <em>b03190d</em>, and the merge commit has disappeared from our
              tree. The commit is still in our repository thou, and we can
              recover it (until the <em>Garbage Collector</em> takes it away for
              good).
            </p>

        </div>

          <div class="left-col">

              If we want to reset to the point before resetting (i.e. a point
              where the merge is still there) we run
            </p>
            <div class="code">

            <p>
              We can now check our log and see that our merge commit is back.
              Keep in mind that if you close Git Bash, the
              <em>Garbage Collector</em> will be run and the commit will be lost
              forever.

              Here we are telling Git that it should revert the

              commit on the <span class="git-green">master</span> branch. The

            <p>
              Git will open VS Code so that we can edit our message, but here
              we'll accept the default and close it. When we do, Git will
              complete the reverting process.
