              Suppose we have a branch called
              <span class="git-aqua">bugfix</span> where we fixed a bug in a
              hurry. In this branch, we did two commits: <em>B1</em> and
              <em>B2</em>. But because we were in a hurry, these are not very
              good commits. So now we need to merge them into
              <span class="git-aqua">master</span> but instead of using a
              three-way merge, we are going to create a <em>squash merge</em>.
              In this type of merge, we create a new commit which is the
              combination of all the commits in our branch but has no ancestry
              to the tip of the branch (in this example, commit <em>B2</em>).
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Once we squash merge we can (and should) delete the
              <span class="git-aqua">bugfix</span> branch. Though this technique
              produces clean linear histories on the
              <span class="git-aqua">master</span> branch, it should only be
              used for short-lived branches with small changes and dirty commit
              histories.

              class="miro-img"
              id="squash-merging-1"
            />
          </div>

        <div class="example"></div>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="left-col">

          <div class="right-col">
            <p>
              As an example, let's create a new branch called
              <span class="git-aqua">bugfix</span>. In this branch, we'll create
              two new commits, one that modifies <em>audience.txt</em> and one
              that modifies <em>toc.txt</em>.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Now we switch onto the
              <span class="git-aqua">master</span> branch. In order to merge the
              <span class="git-aqua">bugfix</span> branch onto
              <span class="git-aqua">master</span>, we run
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git merge --squash bugfix</code>
            </div>
            <p>
              If we check the status of our repository we see that our changes
              are now available on <span class="git-aqua">master</span>, but
              they are not committed. We need to create a commit with these
              changes, and give it a meaningful message that explains the merge.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="left-col">
            <p>
              If we check the log now, we will see that our
              <span class="git-aqua">bugfix</span> branch has two commits:
              <em>3accc2f</em> and <em>2de4c95</em>. Our
              <span class="git-aqua">master</span> branch is at commit
              <em>6166e28</em> which is our squash merge commit, but this commit
              is not connected to the tip of the
              <span class="git-aqua">bugfix</span> branch.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Since the branch was not merged on to
              <span class="git-aqua">master</span>, it is very important that we
              delete it. Otherwise, it will cause confusion in the future once
              we have moved on from this bug and no one even remembers what that
              branch was supposed to do.
