              When working in collaboration with other people we use hosting
              services like GitHub to host a centralized version of the
              repository. There are two possible workflows that we can use:
              <em>Centralized Workflow</em> or
              <em>Integration-Manager Workflow</em>.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              In the <em>Centralized Workflow</em>, all collaborators have push
              authorization and can thus write changes to the central
              repository. They all start by
              <span class="inline-code">cloning</span> the central repository to
              get a local copy of it on their machines. To keep their copy
              up-to-date with what's on the central repository, they use the
              <span class="inline-code">pull</span> command. To send their local
              changes to the central repository they use the
              <span class="inline-code">push</span> command.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              In the <em>Integration-Manager Workflow</em>, only some people
              (known as <em>Maintainers</em>) have <em>push access</em> to the
              central repository. In order to contribute to these projects,
              <em>Contributors</em> need to first
              <span class="inline-code">fork</span> the central repository. This
              creates a copy of the central repository on GitHub to which they
              too have <em>push access</em>. Then they must
              <span class="inline-code">clone</span> this
              <span class="inline-code">forked</span> repository to get a local
              copy on their machines. Once they are done with their proposed
              changes, they <span class="inline-code">push</span> them into
              their <span class="inline-code">forked</span> copy of the
              centralized repository, and for it, send a
              <span class="inline-code">pull request</span> to the
              <em>Maintainer</em> of the original centralized repository.
              <em>Maintainers</em> then review the changes and decide whether
              they want to <span class="inline-code">pull</span> the changes
              into the repository or not.

              The <em>Centralized Workflow</em> is the workflow we commonly use
              for small-scale projects with people we know. The
              <em>Integration-Manager Workflow</em> is the one commonly used for
              open-source projects where anyone can contribute.
            </p>
            <br />

              Many companies use a hybrid workflow. In this workflow, there are
              two roles: the team manager and the contributors, and the
              repository is organized in at least three branches. The
              <span class="git-aqua">master</span> branch is where the
              production code lives. The team manager is in charge of
              maintaining this branch and of merging Pull Requests. Other team
              members work on the <span class="git-aqua">staging</span> and
              <span class="git-aqua">feature</span> branches. When someone needs
              to start working on a new feature, they start by creating a new
              branch from the <span class="git-aqua">staging</span> branch. Once
              they are done working, they send a
              <span class="inline-code">pull request</span> from the
              <span class="git-aqua">feature</span> branch to the
              <span class="git-aqua">staging</span>. Another team member must
              approve it before it can be merged on to the
              <span class="git-aqua">staging</span> branch.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              There's usually a server that runs the code in the
              <span class="git-aqua">staging</span> branch called a
              <em>staging server</em> or <em>staging environment</em>. Once code
              reaches this branch (and thus this server) it is presented to
              clients and/or stakeholders for approval. If approved, the team
              manager merges the <span class="git-aqua">staging</span> branch
              into the <span class="git-aqua">master</span> branch and creates a
              new <span class="git-aqua">release</span> tag. Code that makes it
              to the <span class="git-aqua">master</span> branch is run on the
              <em>production server</em> or <em>production environment</em> and
              makes up the application or program that can be accessed by the
              final users.
