          <p>We can get a less verbose version of the status of our project by running</p>

          </div>
          <p>To show how this works, suppose that we've created a new file <em>file2.txt</em> and modified an existing file, <em>file1.txt</em>. In the short version of the status each file name is preceded by two columns: the left column represents the staging area, and the right column represents the working directory.</p>
          <br>
          <p>In this example, <em>file1.txt</em> is shown with a red <span class="git-red">M</span>. Git is telling us that this file has been modified, but that this modification is not in the staging area, only in the working directory. <em>file1.txt</em> has nothing in the left column since there are no changes in this file affecting its staging area status.</p>

        <div class="right-col">
          <p>If we stage <em>file1.txt</em> and run <span class="inline-code">git status -s</span> again, we see that now <em>file1.txt</em> has a green <span class="git-green">M</span> on the left column. This means that all the changes we had in the working area are not in the staging area. The right column is now empty because we don't have any other changes to add.</p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="left-col">
          <p>Now let's make some more changes to <em>file1.txt</em> and run <span class="inline-code">git status -s</span> one more time. Git is now showing a green <span class="git-green">M</span> on the left-hand column and a red <span class="git-red">M</span> on the right-hand column. This means that there are staged changes and unstaged changes. To add the new changes to the staging area we just run <span class="inline-code">git add file1.txt</span>.</p>

          <p>Now let's take a look at <em>file2.txt</em>. This file has two red <span class="git-red">??</span> because its a new file. To add it to the staging area we just run <span class="inline-code">git add file2.txt</span>. Now the git status has a green <span class="git-green">A</span> on the left-hand side column. This means that the file is new, and it's in the staging area. We can go ahead and commit it if we are satisfied with the changes by running</p>

          <p>If we now delete both files, Git will show them with a green <span class="git-green">D</span> on the left-hand column. This means that they are both going to be deleted.</p>

          <p>If at any time you run <span class="inline-code">git status -s</span> and there are no changes to neither the working nor the staging area, Git will show an empty line.</p>
