          <p>To remove a file (say <em>file2.txt</em>) from our repository we could use <span class="inline-code">rm file2.txt</span>. The problem with this command is that is not a <span class="inline-code">git</span> command. So the file will be removed from the <em>Working Directory</em>, but not from the <em>Staging Area</em>. It's ok to do it this way, just remember that since the file is still in the <em>Staging Area</em>, you'll need to <span class="inline-code">git add</span> it and then <span class="inline-code">git commit</span> it. Since this is such a common operation, there's a Git version of the remove command that does everything in one step.</p>

            <p>You can check which files are in the <em>Staging Area</em> by running</p>

              <code>git ls-files</code>
            </div>
            <p>You should see both files in there: <em>file1.txt</em> and <em>file2.txt</em>. Now to delete <em>file2.txt</em> we use</p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git rm file2.txt</code>
            </div>
            <p>If you run <span class="inline-code">git ls-files</span> again, you should see that <em>file2.txt</em> is no longer in the <em>Staging Area</em>. And if you run <span class="inline-code">ls</span> you'll see that neither is <em>file2.txt</em> in the <em>Working Directory</em>. We have successfully delete <em>file2.txt</em> in one command.</p>
