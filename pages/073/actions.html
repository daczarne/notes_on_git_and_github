              Actions are pieces of code that you or someone else has written to
              run some task. Actions need to be written in JavaScript.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              To use an action we specify it with the <em>uses</em> key. Actions
              can be included in the same repository as the workflow is by
              passing the path to it as a value, or they can be published in
              public GitHub repositories. To use an action that has been
              published in a public GitHub repository the value of the uses key
              needs to be <em>user_name/repo_name@branch_name</em>. We can also
              target a released version with
              <em>user_name/repo_name@tag_name</em>. We can reference a commit
              with <em>user_name/repo_name@commit_sha</em>. The preferred method
              it to use the tag name, since the tip of a branch might change in
              the future and introduce breaking changes. If the version
              references only a mayor, then the latest minor of that mayor will
              be used. Same logic with patches.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Actions might require/allow inputs. The inputs need to be passed
              by name (key) as child elements of the <em>with</em> key.
