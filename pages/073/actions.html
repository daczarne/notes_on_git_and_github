              Actions are pieces of code that you or someone else has written to run some task. Actions need to be
              written in JavaScript.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              To use an action we specify it with the <em>uses</em> key. Actions can be included in the same repository
              as the workflow is by passing the path to it as a value, or they can be published in public GitHub
              repositories. To use an action that has been published in a public GitHub repository the value of the uses
              key needs to be <em>user_name/repo_name@branch_name</em>. We can also target a released version with
              <em>user_name/repo_name@tag_name</em>. We can reference a commit with
              <em>user_name/repo_name@commit_sha</em>. The preferred method it to use the tag name, since the tip of a
              branch might change in the future and introduce breaking changes. If the version references only a mayor,
              then the latest minor of that mayor will be used. Same logic with patches.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Actions might require/allow inputs. The inputs need to be passed by name (key) as child elements of the
              <em>with</em> key.
