              When working in collaboration with other people we use hosting services like GitHub to host a centralized
              version of the repository. There are two possible workflows that we can use: <em>Centralized Workflow</em>
              or <em>Integration-Manager Workflow</em>.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              In the <em>Centralized Workflow</em>, all collaborators have push authorization and can thus write changes
              to the central repository. They all start by <span class="inline-code">cloning</span> the central
              repository to get a local copy of it on their machines. To keep their copy up-to-date with what's on the
              central repository, they use the <span class="inline-code">pull</span> command. To send their local
              changes to the central repository they use the <span class="inline-code">push</span> command.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              In the <em>Integration-Manager Workflow</em>, only some people (known as <em>Maintainers</em>) have
              <em>push access</em> to the central repository. In order to contribute to these projects,
              <em>Contributors</em> need to first <span class="inline-code">fork</span> the central repository. This
              creates a copy of the central repository on GitHub to which they have <em>push access</em>. Then they must
              <span class="inline-code">clone</span> this <span class="inline-code">forked</span> repository to get a
              local copy on their machines. Once they are done with their proposed changes, they
              <span class="inline-code">push</span> them into their <span class="inline-code">forked</span> copy of the
              centralized repository, and from it, send a <span class="inline-code">pull request</span> to the
              <em>Maintainer</em> of the original centralized repository. <em>Maintainers</em> then review the changes
              and decide whether they want to <span class="inline-code">pull</span> the changes into the repository or
              not.

              The <em>Centralized Workflow</em> is the workflow we commonly use for projects with people we know. The
              <em>Integration-Manager Workflow</em> is the one commonly used for open-source projects where anyone can
              contribute.
            </p>

              Many companies use a hybrid workflow. In this workflow, there are two roles: the team manager and the
              contributors, and the repository is organized in at least three branches. The
              <span class="git-aqua">master</span> branch is where the production code lives. The team manager is in
              charge of maintaining this branch and of merging Pull Requests. Other team members work on the
              <span class="git-aqua">staging</span> and <span class="git-aqua">feature</span> branches. When someone
              needs to start working on a new feature, they start by creating a new branch from the
              <span class="git-aqua">staging</span> branch. Once they are done working, they send a
              <span class="inline-code">pull request</span> from the <span class="git-aqua">feature</span> branch to the
              <span class="git-aqua">staging</span>. Another team member must approve it before it can be merged on to
              the <span class="git-aqua">staging</span> branch.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              There's usually a server that runs the code in the <span class="git-aqua">staging</span> branch called a
              <em>staging server</em>. Once code reaches this branch (and thus this server) it is presented to clients
              and/or stakeholders for approval. If approved, the team manager merges the
              <span class="git-aqua">staging</span> branch into the <span class="git-aqua">master</span> branch and
              creates a new <span class="git-aqua">release</span> tag. Code that makes it to the
              <span class="git-aqua">master</span> branch is run on the <em>production server</em> and makes up the
              application or program that can be accessed by the final users.
