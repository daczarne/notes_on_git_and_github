            <p>
              Sometimes we do a merge and realize that our program stopped working and we want to undo it. Here we have
              two options: 1) undoing the commit as if it had never been there (called resetting), 2) create a new
              commit that cancels out all the changes in our merge commit (called reverting).
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              When resetting we have to be very careful because we are re-writing history. If the changes only exist on
              our local repository that is OK. But if we have already shared the changes with the rest of our team we
              should <span class="here">NEVER</span> re-write history.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The diagrams below explain the two situations. In both of them, we begin from the same starting point: a
              merger commit has taken place, merging a branch called <span class="git-aqua">new-feature</span> into
              <span class="git-aqua">master</span>. The difference is that when we use <em>reset</em> we move the
              <span class="git-green">master</span> pointer back to its parent commit (the commit with a red border that
              is before the merge commit, and in the <span class="git-green">master</span> branch). Because there are
              now no commits or pointers pointing to our merger commit, Git will <em>Garbage Collect</em> this commit
              and throw it away.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              On the other hand, when we use a <em>revert</em> we are creating a new commit that comes after the merge
              commit, and moving the <span class="git-green">HEAD</span> pointer onto this new commit (shown in blue
              with white border on the diagram). This commit makes all the opposite changes as those that were done on
              the merge commit. One thing to consider when reverting mergers is that the merge commit actually has two
              parent commits: one on <span class="git-green">master</span> and one on
              <span class="git-green">new-feature</span>. We'll have to specify Git which commit to revert to and, since
              we'll do it from the <span class="git-green">master</span> branch (because it's the branch that was
              modified with the merger), we'll revert to the parent commit on this branch.

              Before we start with an example, let's take a look at our log. We'll do both operations on commit
              <em>3a485a4</em>, which is our last merge commit. Before starting an operation like this, it's always
              recommended that you write down the ID for the commit you are going to revert or reset. You can delete it
              once done.

              We'll start with the <em>reset</em> option. But before we do we need to clarify some terminology. The
              <span class="inline-code">git reset</span> command has three options:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span class="inline-code">--soft</span>: Git will have our repository point to a different commit, but
                our index and working tree will not be affected.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="inline-code">--mixed</span>: Git will take the new snapshot and put it in the index as
                well. This is the default option so we don't need to specify it.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="inline-code">--hard</span>: Git will take the new snapshot and copy it to both the index
                and the working tree. This means that all environments will look the same. It also means that all local
                changes in our working-tree will be lost, so make sure to stash them before resetting.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>

              To reset our repository, index, and working tree in the <span class="git-aqua">master</span> branch to the

            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git reset --hard HEAD~1</code>
            </div>
            <p>
              We can see that both <span class="git-aqua">HEAD</span> and <span class="git-green">master</span> are now
              at commit <em>b03190d</em>, and the merge commit has disappeared from our tree. The commit is still in our
              repository thou, and we can recover it (until the <em>Garbage Collector</em> takes it away for good).
            </p>
          </div>

        <div class="row">

              We can now check our log and see that our merge commit is back. Keep in mind that if you close Git Bash,
              the <em>Garbage Collector</em> will be run and the commit will be lost forever.

              Here we are telling Git that it should revert the <span class="inline-code">HEAD</span> pointer to the
              previous commit on the <span class="git-green">master</span> branch. The
              <span class="inline-code">-m 1</span> means <em>first parent commit</em>.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Git will open VS Code so that we can edit our message, but here we'll accept the default and close it.
              When we do, Git will complete the reverting process.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              We can check our log now and see that a new commit has been added and its message says that it has
              reverted the merge.
