              In Git we can change the base commit of a branch by using a
              technique called <span class="inline-code">rebasing</span>.
              Suppose we have a repository that looks like the one on the
              diagram. The way rebasing seems to work is by moving the base
              commit of a branch (that is the parent commit of <em>F1</em>). The
              problem with rebasing is that this is not true. Commits are
              immutable. So what Git actually does is to create new commits (in
              this example, <em>F1<sup>*</sup></em> and <em>F2<sup>*</sup></em
              >) that come after the
              <span class="git-aqua">master</span> pointer, and moves the branch
              pointer from <em>F2</em> to <em>F2<sup>*</sup></em
              >. Now there are no pointers or commits pointing to <em>F2</em> so
              Git will delete them on the next
              <em>Garbage Collection</em> cycle. This might be OK if this branch
              is local (only you have it on your computer), but if other people
              created commits on top of <em>F2</em> their work will be lost
              too!! So be very careful when rebasing.

            <p>
              To see an example of rebasing, I've created a new branch called
              <span class="git-aqua">feature</span>. In this branch, I've
              updated the <em>toc.txt</em>. Back in the
              <span class="git-aqua">master</span> branch, I've updated the
              <em>main.js</em> file. If we look at the log we can see that both
              branches have diverged. The new
              <span class="git-aqua">feature</span> branch is at
              <em>9795f10</em>, <span class="git-aqua">master</span> is at
              <em>4104ec7</em>, and their last common ancestor is
              <em>6166e28</em>.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              When we rebase the <span class="git-aqua">feature</span> branch we
              will change its base commit from <em>6166e28</em> (which was the
              commit that our <span class="git-aqua">master</span> branch was at
              when we created the <span class="git-aqua">feature</span> branch),
              to commit <em>4104ec7</em> (which is the commit where
              <span class="git-aqua">master</span> is now).
            </p>

            <img src="rebasing_05.png" alt="Rebasing 5" class="git-bash-img" />

        <div class="row">

          <div class="right-col">
            <p>
              To rebase, make sure that you are on the target branch, in this
              case, <span class="git-aqua">feature</span>. Now we run
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git rebase master</code>
            </div>
            <p>
              This is telling Git to change the base of the current branch (in
              this case <span class="git-aqua">feature</span>) with the tip of
              the branch that we supply (in this case
              <span class="git-aqua">master</span>). Usually, when rebasing
              there will be conflicts that we must resolve the same way that we
              resolve merge conflicts.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Now if we check our log we can see that there's a linear path from
              <span class="git-aqua">master</span> to our
              <span class="git-aqua">feature</span> branch. If we merge these
              branches, Git will do a simple fast-forward merge. But take a
              close look at the commit IDs. Before the rebase, the tip of our
              branch was at commit <em>9795f10</em>, now it's at commit
              <em>6f25ebf</em>. This is a new commit!
            </p>

        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="left-col">
            <p>
              We can checkout to the old commit <em>9795f10</em> and use the log
              to see the graph. The new tip of the rebased branch is in fact an
              entirely new commit. The old one still exists. But there are no
              pointers pointing to it, Git will Garbage Collect it.

              Back on the <span class="git-aqua">master</span> branch, we can
              now merge the <span class="git-aqua">feature</span> branch onto it
              and Git will resolve it with a fast-forward merge. If we check out
              the log again, we'll see that both branches are now pointing to
              the same commit.

              A few comments about rebasing conflicts. When Git tries to rebase,
              it will start by taking the oldest commit in the current branch
              and adding it to the tip of the target branch. If there's a
              conflict we'll have to open VS Code and solve it the same way we
              would solve a merge conflict. But because Git does a rebase one
              commit at a time, when we are done, we need to run
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git rebase --continue</code>
            </div>
            <p>
              This will let Git know that it can continue to the next commit. If
              we wish to skip one commit, we run
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git rebase --skip</code>
            </div>
            <p>
              Git will not create a copy of that commit and move on to the next
              one. If at any point in time we wish to stop the rebase all
              together, we run
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git rebase --abort</code>
            </div>
            <p>
              This will tell Git to stop the rebase and revert everything back
              to before we even started.
