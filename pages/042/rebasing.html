              In Git we can change the base commit of a branch by using a technique called
              <span class="inline-code">rebasing</span>. Suppose we have a repository that looks like the one on the
              diagram. The way rebasing seems to work is by moving the base commit of a branch (that is the parent
              commit of <em>F1</em>). The problem with rebasing is that this is not true. Commits are immutable. So what
              Git actually does is to create new commits (in this example, <em>F1<sup>*</sup></em> and
              <em>F2<sup>*</sup></em>) that come after the <span class="git-aqua">master</span> pointer, and moves the
              branch pointer from <em>F2</em> to <em>F2<sup>*</sup></em>. Now there are no pointers or commits pointing
              to <em>F2</em> so Git will delete them on the next <em>Garbage Collection</em> cycle. This might be OK if
              this branch is local (only you have it on your computer), but if other people created commits on top of
              <em>F2</em> their work will be lost too!! So be very careful when rebasing.

              To see an example of rebasing, I've created a new branch called <span class="git-aqua">feature</span>. In
              this branch, I've updated the <em>toc.txt</em>. Back in the <span class="git-aqua">master</span> branch,
              I've updated the <em>main.js</em> file. If we look at the log we can see that both branches have diverged.
              The new <span class="git-aqua">feature</span> branch is at <em>9795f10</em>,
              <span class="git-aqua">master</span> is at <em>4104ec7</em>, and their last common ancestor is
              <em>6166e28</em>.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              When we rebase the <span class="git-aqua">feature</span> branch we will change its base commit from
              <em>6166e28</em> (which was the commit that our <span class="git-aqua">master</span> branch was at
              when we created the <span class="git-aqua">feature</span> branch), to commit <em>4104ec7</em> (which is
              the commit where <span class="git-aqua">master</span> is now).

          <div class="right-col">
            <p>
              To rebase, make sure that you are on the target branch, in this case,
              <span class="git-aqua">feature</span>. Now we run
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git rebase master</code>
            </div>
            <p>
              This is telling Git to change the base of the current branch (in this case
              <span class="git-aqua">feature</span>) with the tip of the branch that we supply (in this case
              <span class="git-aqua">master</span>). Usually, when rebasing there will be conflicts that we must resolve
              the same way that we resolve merge conflicts.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Now if we check our log we can see that there's a linear path from <span class="git-aqua">master</span> to
              our <span class="git-aqua">feature</span> branch. If we merge these branches, Git will do a simple
              fast-forward merge. But take a close look at the commit IDs. Before the rebase, the tip of our branch was
              at commit <em>9795f10</em>, now it's at commit <em>6f25ebf</em>. This is a new commit!
            </p>

        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="left-col">
            <p>
              We can checkout to the old commit <em>9795f10</em> and use the log to see the graph. The new tip of the
              rebased branch is in fact an entirely new commit. The old one still exists. But there are no pointers
              pointing to it, Git will Garbage Collect it.

              Back on the <span class="git-aqua">master</span> branch, we can now merge the
              <span class="git-aqua">feature</span> branch onto it and Git will resolve it with a fast-forward merge. If
              we check out the log again, we'll see that both branches are now pointing to the same commit.

              A few comments about rebasing conflicts. When Git tries to rebase, it will start by taking the oldest
              commit in the current branch and adding it to the tip of the target branch. If there's a conflict we'll
              have to open VS Code and solve it the same way we would solve a merge conflict. But because Git does a
              rebase one commit at a time, when we are done, we need to run
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git rebase --continue</code>
            </div>
            <p>
              This will let Git know that it can continue to the next commit. If we wish to skip one commit, we run
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git rebase --skip</code>
            </div>
            <p>
              Git will not create a copy of that commit and move on to the next one. If at any point in time we wish to
              stop the rebase all together, we run
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git rebase --abort</code>
            </div>
            <p>
              This will tell Git to stop the rebase and revert everything back to before we even started.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="example"></div>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="single-col">
            <p>
              If before starting a rebase we already know that we always want to keep the changes as they are in the
              <span class="git-aqua">feature</span> branch, we can run the rebase with the
              <span class="inline-code">-Xtheirs</span> option.
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git rebase -Xtheirs <i>NEW_BASE_BRANCH</i></code>
            </div>
            <p>
              Likewise, if before starting the rebase we already know that we wish to keep the changes in the
              <span class="git-aqua">master</span> branch, the we use the <span class="inline-code">-Xours</span>
              option.
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git rebase -Xours <i>NEW_BASE_BRANCH</i></code>
            </div>
            <p>
              This <span class="inline-code">-X</span> option is called the <em>strategy option</em>. You should keep in
              mind that when we supply a strategy to be used by default, said strategy is used in all commits that are
              being rebased.
