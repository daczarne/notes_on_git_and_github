              Suppose our project looks like the one on the right and we found a bug we didn't know existed or what
              caused it. We could check every single commit one-by-one until we find it, but that is time-consuming.
              <span class="inline-code">bisect</span> is a Git tool for finding bugs in our code.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              In a nutshell, it works by doing a binary search throughout our repository. We'll tell Git of a
              <em>good</em> commit, and a <em>bad</em> commit and Git will help us zero-in the commit that caused the
              bug so that we can fix it.
            </p>

              So, imagine <em>8eec1d2</em> (our <span class="inline-code">HEAD</span>) is a bad commit (we found a bug
              here), and <em>ca49180</em> (our initial commit) will be our first good commit (a commit that we know did
              not have the issue).
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              To start <span class="inline-code">bisect</span> we simply run
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git bisect start</code>
            </div>
            <p>
              Notice that Git Bash changed from <span class="git-aqua">(master)</span> to
              <span class="git-aqua">(master | BISECTING)</span>. Right now our <span class="inline-code">HEAD</span> is
              at the bad commit (the last one), so we need to tell Git that this is a bad commit. To do that, we run
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git bisect bad</code>
            </div>
            <p>
              Now we need to give Git a good commit. If you didn't write down the hash for a good commit before starting
              the <span class="inline-code">bisect</span> process don't worry, you can run
              <span class="inline-code">git log --oneline</span> and get it now. So we run
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git bisect good ca49180</code>
            </div>
            <p>
              Now Git is telling us that we have 7 revisions left (7 commits to check instead of the total 16), and it's
              also telling us that we can get it done in 3 steps. Notice that Git Bash changed again and is not at
              commit <em>24e86ee</em> anymore.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="right-col">
            <img src="bisect_02.png" alt="Bisect 2" class="git-bash-img" />
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="single-col">
            <p>
              If we now run <span class="inline-code">git log --oneline --all</span> we see that
              <span class="git-green">master</span> is at the top and it's referenced as a bad commit. At the bottom of
              the log, we see that there's a second reference for our bad commit. Our <span class="git-aqua">HEAD</span>
              is at commit <em>24e86ee</em>. This means that our working directory has been restored to this point in
              time. Therefore, we can test and see if the bug is here already. If it is, that means that the bug was
              introduced somewhere between <em>ca49180</em> and <span class="git-aqua">HEAD</span>. If it is not, then
              the bug was introduced somewhere between <span class="git-aqua">HEAD</span> and
              <span class="git-green">master</span>. Either way, we eliminated half of all possible commits in one try.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>For this demo, let's tell Git that this is a good commit</p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git bisect good</code>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="left-col">
            <img src="bisect_03.png" alt="Bisect 3" class="git-bash-img" />
          </div>
          <div class="right-col">
            <p>
              Now Git is telling us that there are 3 revisions left and that it will take 2 steps to inspect them. Our
              <span class="git-aqua">HEAD</span> has now moved to commit <em>50db987</em>. If we look at the log again,
              we see that it has moved up. Our repository has once again been checked out to this commit. So we can test
              our application here and see if the bug is there or not. Again for this demo, we'll tell Git that this is
              a good commit. So again we run
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git bisect good</code>
            </div>
            <p>
              And we'll do it one more time so that it moves to the commit prior to
              <span class="git-green">master</span>.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="left-col">
            <p>
              Now we are at commit <em>e22efe7</em> and suppose that we found the bug here. We'll tell Git that this is
              a bad commit
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git bisect bad</code>
            </div>
            <p>
              Now Git knows which one was the first bad commit and it's giving us all the information about that commit:
              author, date, a summary of changes.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Now we can inspect and test our code here and find the bug. Once we know how to fix it, we can move our
              <span class="inline-code">HEAD</span> back to <span class="inline-code">master</span> and implement the
              fix.
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git bisect reset</code>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="right-col">
