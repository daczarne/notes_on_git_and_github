              Releases are a GitHub (not Git) feature that is built on top of
              tags (every release requires a tag). To create one, go to your
              repositories home page and, on the right-hand panel, click on
              <em>Releases</em>. You'll be directed to the releases page. Now
              click on <em>Create a new release</em>.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              First, we need to give it a <em>Tag version</em>. If we already
              have tags we can use one of those. If we don't have a tag, when we
              create the release, GitHub will add it to the latest commit on the
              branch that we select.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Next, select the branch. Generally, programs are released based on
              the master branch, but you can select any other branch in your
              repository.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Then, write a <em>Release Title</em>. It can be anything you want.
              Here I use the tag name.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              After that, we can include our release notes. You have to use
              Markdown syntax for it.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="right-col">
            <img
              src="releases_01.png"
              alt="Releases 1"
              class="github-img releases-img"
            />
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="single-col">
            <p>
              Below that, you'll see the list of files GitHub will include in
              the release. By default, it will include all the source code up to
              that point in time, but you can add other files like binaries.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              If your release is a pre-release (maybe your software is not
              stable yet) you can mark it as a pre-release. When done, just
              click on the <em>Publish release</em> button.
            </p>

              class="github-img releases-img"

          </div>
          <div class="right-col">
            <p>
              You'll be redirected to the releases panel. Here you can see all
              your releases and their notes. On the left-hand side, you can see
              the commit based on which the release was done. If you click on
              <em>Compare</em> you can compare the state of your code at
              different releases.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Next to your user name and the date on the central panel, GitHub
              will show you the number of commits that were pushed to that
              branch since that release. Currently is not showing anything
              because there aren't any new commits.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Finally, on the right-hand side, you can choose to
              <em>Edit</em> or <em>Delete</em> the release.
