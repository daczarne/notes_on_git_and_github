              Some environment variables are set up automatically by GitHub (in the runner). We can use these variables
              in our workflows by referencing them with <em>$VARIABLE_NAME</em>.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>Some of them are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li class="uc-li">
                <span class="inline-code">$GITHUB_SHA</span> will return the SHA of the commit that triggered the
                workflow
              </li>
              <li class="uc-li">
                <span class="inline-code">$GITHUB_REPOSITORY</span> will return the <em>user_name/repo_name</em> in
                which the workflow is running
              </li>
              <li class="uc-li">
                <span class="inline-code">$GITHUB_WORKSPACE</span> will return the workspace directory in the runner
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <p>
              You can see the complete list of built-in environment variables
              <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/environment-variables"
                class="here">here</a>.

        <!-- Custom environment variables -->
        <div class="example"></div>

              We can define our own environment variables as well. To declare a variable we need to use the <em>env</em>
              key at the start of our workflow. This key takes as its value a list of key:value pairs, where the keys
              are the names of the environment variables that we are declaring, and its values are the values of the
              variables.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              After that we can just write our jobs as we would normally do. To access the variables we just need to use
              the <em>${ VAR_NAME }</em> syntax.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Variables declared this way will be available to the whole workflow. Variables that need to only be
              available to a specific job in the workflow are declared and used in the same way, but using the
              <em>env</em> in that specific job.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Likewise, if we want a variable to only be available in a step of a job, we use declare and use it in that
              step.

              Some variables need to be encrypted. To do so, we just need to add the variable value in <i>Settings &gt
                Secrets &gt Actions &gt New repository secret</i>. Give it a name and a value, and save it. These
              variables will be available in a workflow using an object called secrets.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              One secret that is automatically available on workflows is <em>secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN</em>. This token can
              be used to access the GitHub API, or to push something to the repo, etc. Basically, any time that the
              action needs to interact with the repository it will need authentication, and we can use this variable to
              do it.

              Secrets can be safely logged because GitHub will never expose them to the logs. It will print them as
              asterisks.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The authentication token can also be accessed via the <em>github</em> object. This object is automatically
              set for us by GitHub and contains several other values too. More on that object later.

              Secrets are useful but they have a limit of 6kbs. Likewise, we might be using some CLI commands in a
              workflow that uses some secrets that need to be stored in a JSON file. We can push encrypted versions of
              those files and then include a decryption step in our jobs.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              To encrypt the file locally we can use tools like <a href="https://www.gnupg.org/" class="here">GPG</a>.
              For details on how to use this tool, refer to the encrypted secrets documentation
              <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets" class="here">here</a>.
              Since this files require a passphrase to be decrypted, that passphrase needs to be added as a repository
              secret. And since the encrypted file itself needs to be available in the runner, workflows that require
              them must first include a checkout step.
