              Once we are finished making changes locally, you have to
              <span class="inline-code">push</span> them on to the remote
              repository so that others can see them too. To do this we run
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git push <em>remote</em> <em>branch</em> </code>
            </div>
            <p>
              Here <em>branch</em> is the remote branch to which we want to push
              to. If we omit it, then Git will assume you want to push to the
              <span class="git-green">main</span> branch. <em>remote</em> refers
              to the remote repository to which you wish to push to. If omitted,
              Git will assume that you want to push onto origin.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              If this is your first time pushing onto a remote, Git will ask for
              your GitHub credentials so that it can authenticate and make sure
              you have push access. We'll see how to store them next so that you
              don't have to supply them every time you push.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Sometimes, others will have pushed their changes before you. If
              so, Git will not let you push your changes until you update your
              local repository with the remote one. If this is the case, you
              just need to pull before you can push. Keep in mind that when
              pulling, you may encounter merge conflicts that you will have to
              resolve before being able to push.

              Some people online will tell you that when your changes get
              rejected, you should force push by running
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git push -f</code>
            </div>
            <p class="center">or</p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git push --force</code>
            </div>
            <p>
              You should <a href="#" class="here">NEVER</a>
              <a href="#" class="here">EVER</a>
              <a href="#" class="here">EVER</a>
              <a href="#" class="here">EVER</a> force push onto a remote
              repository unless you have discussed it with your teammates and
              everyone is in line with this action. What a force push does is it
              tells GitHub that it should discard all commits ahead of your
              local repository, and push your changes. So you are throwing away
              your teammates work.
