              We can restore files that we deleted in previous commits. Suppose
              that we accidentally removed <em>app.py</em> and now we need it
              back. The first thing that we need to do is find the last commit
              where that file was not deleted. To do that we run
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git log --oneline -- app.py</code>
            </div>
            <p>
              So far nothing new. Now, since the file will show up on the commit
              in which we delete it, the last commit were the file was not
              deleted is the second commit from the top: commit
              <em>8eec1d2</em>. What we need to do now is to
              <span class="inline-code">git checkout</span> just that file from
              that commit. So we run
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git checkout 8eec1d2 app.py</code>
            </div>
            <p>
              Git will take the file as it was at that point in time and place
              it in our staging area. That is why if we run a
              <span class="inline-code">git status -s</span> we can see that the
              file has an <span class="git-green">A</span> on the left column.
              Lastly, we commit the file to the repository.
