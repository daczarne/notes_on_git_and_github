              A <em>Pull Request</em> (from now on, PR) is a way of opening a discussion on a repository so that we can
              get feedback from other team members on our code. In many organizations, opening PRs to merge code into
              production or staging branches, and reviewing other's people code is mandatory, even for the most senior
              developers.

              To see a scenario, let's suppose we just created a new commit on a branch called
              <span class="git-aqua">bugfix</span> and we pushed it to the remote repository. If we now go to GitHub,
              we'll see the message to create a PR. To start creating a PR, click on it. Alternatively, you can go to
              the Pull Requests tab and start it from there.

              You'll see a screen like the one below. First, we need to select two branches. The <em>base branch</em> is
              the branch that we want to merge our code into (here we'll choose main), our <em>compare branch</em> is
              the branch that has the code we want to merge into the <em>base branch</em> (in this case, I called the
              branch bugfix). Next to the branch selectors, GitHub is telling us that this branch can be merged without
              generating conflicts. This will not always be the case. If GitHub tells us that there are conflicts that
              will have to be resolved, that's OK, first our code needs to be approved by our teammates anyway.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Below that we can see the summary of changes. GitHub is telling us that this PR will include 1 commit,
              with changes to 1 file. After that, it shows us a graph of the involved commits. At the bottom we can see
              the diffs for the different files (you can toggle the views by pressing the Unified and Split buttons on
              the right). When you are done reviewing this page, click on <em>Create pull request</em>.

              In this new screen we need to first enter the PR's title. Because this PR has only 1 commit, GitHub used
              the commit message as a PR title. Usually you should change it to something more meaningful, related to
              the task at hand (like feature name or bugfix and the ID of the bugfix task).
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              In the details section of the PR you can write whatever you want. Usually we list the changes or functions
              that were implemented plus a short description of what they do. If there's any part of your code that you
              want your teammates to pay special attention to, this is where you should include that. When ready, click
              on the <em>Create pull request</em> button.

              Now, if a reviewer was not assigned automatically, you need to assign one. You can assign more than one
              too. The yellow dot next to each reviewer's name indicates that they are still to respond to the review
              request.

              From now on I'll be changing roles in this demo playing the role of the creator of the PR and the
              reviewer, but I'll always use the pronoun you since in the real world you'll have to do both: sometimes
              you'll be the creator of the PR (when you are sharing your code with your teammates and need someone to
              review it), and sometimes you'll be the reviewer (when another teammate is submitting code and asking that
              you review it). When playing the PR creator's role the screen will be in dark theme. When playing the role
              of the reviewer it will be in light theme.

              When someone asks for their code to be reviewed by you, GitHub will send you an email. Upon logging into
              GitHub you'll see a message that says that a teammate requested a review from you. Click on the
              <em>Add your review</em> button.

              After adding all of your comments, click on the <em>Review changes</em> button in the top-right corner.
              Here you can add a general message and approve, comment, or request changes from the PR owner (the
              teammate who submitted it).

              Let's go back to supposing that you are the person who created the PR now. When the reviewer submits the
              review, you'll get an email from GitHub saying that your code has been reviewed. Since in this case
              changes were requested, you'll see a red icon next to the reviewer's name.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Next, you'll go back to the code, implement the requested changes (if you agree with them of course), and
              push the new commit onto the remote repository. Now you can request a new review by pressing the arrows
              next to the red icon.

              Back in the reviewer's role. You received an email from your teammate saying that there's a new version of
              the code. You review it again and since you are now OK with the code, you click on the <em>Viewed</em>
              button. Now you submit a new review, this time approving the changes.

              The person who submitted the PR will now see a green check mark next to the reviewer's name. So now it's
              time to merge the PR onto the base branch.

              Back in the PR's discussion panel you'll see a <em>Merge pull request</em> at the bottom. Who should merge
              is something that depends on the type of project and the culture and rules of the organization. Some
              prefer that a person other than the one who opened the PR merges it, some prefer the person who created it
              to merge it. Just follow the rules and customs of your organization.
            </p>
            <br />

              To merge, all you have to do is select the type of merge and click on the merge button.

              Once done, don't forget to delete the branch. To delete the remote branch you can just click on delete
              branch. To delete the local branch on your computer, remember to first pull, switch to main, and then
              delete and prune.

            <br />
            <p>
              If you delete a branch by mistake, don't worry. Once you click on the <em>Delete branch</em> button, it'll
              change to <em>Restore branch</em>.

              As a side note, if during the PR process conflicts with the <em>base branch</em> appear, you'll see this
              message on the PR panel. You can resolve the conflict the same way as we saw before using VS Code, or you
              can click on the <em>Resolve conflicts</em> button on GitHub. Either way you do it, the conflict is
              resolved the same way and the interface is pretty much the same.
