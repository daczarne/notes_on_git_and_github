              The <span class="inline-code">git status -s</span> only tells us
              which files have changed. To explore what we have in the staging
              area we use

              The first line of this output tells us that the
              <span class="inline-code">diff</span> utility was called to
              compare two versions of <em>file1.txt</em>. The copy prefixed with
              <span class="inline-code">a</span> is the old copy (the one we had
              in the last commit). The copy prefixed with
              <span class="inline-code">b</span> is the one we have in the
              staging area. Next, we have a legend with the IDs. After that,
              there's a line with
              <span class="inline-code">--- a/file1.txt</span> and another one
              with <span class="inline-code">+++ b/file1.txt</span>. Changes to
              the old copy are prefixed with minus signs and changes to the new
              copy are prefixed with plus signs. After that, there's a header
              with information about which parts of the files have changed. This
              is because Git will not show the entire file (if it's too long),
              just a chunk. Each chunk has a header that looks like that. The
              first part of the header says
              <span class="inline-code">-1,3</span>. This means Git is showing
              lines 1 through 3 of the old copy.
            </p>

          <div class="right-col">

          <div class="single-col">

              The second part of the header says
              <span class="inline-code">+1,5</span>. This means Git is showing
              us lines 1 through 5 of the new copy. Below that we can see the
              difference between the two of them. The
              <span class="git-green">+sky</span> and
              <span class="git-green">+ocean</span> mean that those two lines
              are new lines that are being added in the new version of the file.

              Now we'll compare two versions of <em>file2.txt</em>. In this
              case, Git is showing
              <span class="inline-code">--- /dev/null</span> along with a header
              of <span class="inline-code">-0,0</span> because the file is new.
              So, from the "previous" (none-existing) version is pulling lines 0
              through 0.

              If instead, we wish to compare files in the working area to files
              in the staging area, we use the same command but without the
              <span class="inline-code">--staged</span> option. So,
            </p>
            <div class="code">

              Here Git is telling us that in <em>file1.txt</em> the first two
              lines (<span class="git-red">hello</span> and
              <span class="git-red">world</span>) were removed and replaced with
              a new line (<span class="git-green">hello world</span>).
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="single-col">
            <p>
              As you may have probably guessed already, this is not how we
              inspect changes. To inspect changes we use a <em>diff tool</em>.
              Here we'll use VS Code. So first we need to set VS Code as our
              default diff tool. To do that, we run
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git config --global diff.tool vscode</code>
            </div>
            <p>
              With this command, we are just giving a name to our default
              <em>diff tool</em>. Now we need to tell Git how to launch our diff
              tool. To do this we run
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>
                git config --global difftool.vscode.cmd "code --wait --diff
                $LOCAL $REMOTE"
              </code>
            </div>
            <p>
              For this to work remember that you must have added VS Code to your
              system path. If you forgot about that, the easiest way is to just
              reinstall VS Code and check the add to PATH checkbox on the
              installation wizard. <span class="inline-code">code</span> just
              tells the command prompt that it needs to open VS Code. The
              <span class="inline-code">--wait</span> option tells the command
              prompt that it needs to wait until we are done with VS Code. The
              <span class="inline-code">--diff</span> option tells VS Code that
              we want to use it for <em>diffing</em> files. Lastly,
              <span class="inline-code">$LOCAL</span> and
              <span class="inline-code">$REMOTE</span> are placeholders for the
              older and newer versions of the file.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="left-col">
            <p>To check that everything went OK, just run</p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git config --global -e</code>
            </div>
            <p>
              This will open the Git settings in VS Code. You should see the
              commands we just run at the bottom of the file. Make sure that
              they are just as we typed them. So <em>tool = vscode</em> and
              <em>cmd = "code --wait --diff $LOCAL $REMOTE"</em>. If there are
              any mistakes, you can correct them there. Just remember to save
              your changes before closing.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="right-col">
            <img
              src="viewing_changes_03.png"
              alt="Viewing changes 3"

          <div class="single-col">

              Now, all we need to do is to change the
              <span class="inline-code">diff</span> part of our command with
              <span class="inline-code">difftool</span> and select
              <span class="inline-code">Y</span> when prompted by Git Bash. This
              will open VS Code with both versions of our file placed side by
              side. The old copy that we have in the staging area is shown on
              the left-hand side panel, and the new copy that we have in the
              working directory is shown on the right-hand side panel.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="single-col">
            <div class="center">
              <img
                src="viewing_changes_04.png"
                alt="Viewing changes 4"
                class="vscode-img"
              />
            </div>

        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="single-col">
            <p>
              Now we can take a look at the diffs in the staging area by running
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git difftool --staged</code>
            </div>
            <p>
              In this case, the old copy (left) is what we had on the last
              commit, and the new copy (right) is what we have on the staging
              area. If more than one file is affected then, once we are done
              with the first one and close VS Code, Git Bash will ask us if we
              want to look at the other one.
