              The <span class="inline-code">git status -s</span> only tells us which files have changed. To explore
              what we have in the staging area we use
            </p>
            <div class="code">

              The first line of this output tells us that the <span class="inline-code">diff</span> utility was called
              to compare two versions of <em>file1.txt</em>. The copy prefixed with <span class="inline-code">a</span>
              is the old copy (the one we had in the last commit). The copy prefixed with
              <span class="inline-code">b</span> is the one we have in the staging area. Next, we have a legend with
              the IDs. After that, there's a line with <span class="inline-code">--- a/file1.txt</span> and another one
              with <span class="inline-code">+++ b/file1.txt</span>. Changes to the old copy are prefixed with minus
              signs and changes to the new copy are prefixed with plus signs. After that, there's a header with
              information about which parts of the files have changed. This is because Git will not show the entire
              file (if it's too long), just a chunk. Each chunk has a header that looks like that. The first part of
              the header says <span class="inline-code">-1,3</span>. This means Git is showing lines 1 through 3 of the
              old copy.

        <div class="row">
          <div class="single-col">
            <p>
              The second part of the header says <span class="inline-code">+1,5</span>. This means Git is showing us
              lines 1 through 5 of the new copy. Below that we can see the difference between the two of them. The
              <span class="git-green">+sky</span> and <span class="git-green">+ocean</span> mean that those two lines
              are new lines that are being added in the new version of the file.

              Now we'll compare two versions of <em>file2.txt</em>. In this case, Git is showing
              <span class="inline-code">--- /dev/null</span> along with a header of
              <span class="inline-code">-0,0</span> because the file is new. So, from the "previous" (none-existing)
              version is pulling lines 0 through 0.

              If instead, we wish to compare files in the working area to files in the staging area, we use the same
              command but without the <span class="inline-code">--staged</span> option. So,
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git diff</code>
            </div>
            <p>
              Here Git is telling us that in <em>file1.txt</em> the first two lines
              (<span class="git-red">hello</span> and <span class="git-red">world</span>) were removed and replaced with
              a new line (<span class="git-green">hello world</span>).
            </p>

            <p>
              As you may have probably guessed already, this is not how we inspect changes. To inspect changes we use a
              <em>diff tool</em>. Here we'll use VS Code. So first we need to set VS Code as our default diff tool. To
              do that, we run
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git config --global diff.tool vscode</code>
            </div>
            <p>
              With this command, we are just giving a name to our default <em>diff tool</em>. Now we need to tell Git
              how to launch our diff tool. To do this we run
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>
                git config --global difftool.vscode.cmd "code --wait --diff
                $LOCAL $REMOTE"
              </code>
            </div>
            <p>
              For this to work remember that you must have added VS Code to your system path. If you forgot about that,
              the easiest way is to just reinstall VS Code and check the add to PATH checkbox on the installation
              wizard. <span class="inline-code">code</span> just tells the command prompt that it needs to open VS
              Code. The <span class="inline-code">--wait</span> option tells the command prompt that it needs to wait
              until we are done with VS Code. The <span class="inline-code">--diff</span> option tells VS Code that
              we want to use it for <em>diffing</em> files. Lastly, <span class="inline-code">$LOCAL</span> and
              <span class="inline-code">$REMOTE</span> are placeholders for the older and newer versions of the file.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="left-col">
            <p>To check that everything went OK, just run</p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git config --global -e</code>
            </div>
            <p>
              This will open the Git settings in VS Code. You should see the commands we just run at the bottom of the
              file. Make sure that they are just as we typed them. So <em>tool = vscode</em> and
              <em>cmd = "code --wait --diff $LOCAL $REMOTE"</em>. If there are any mistakes, you can correct them there.
              Just remember to save your changes before closing.
            </p>

          <div class="right-col">
            <img src="viewing_changes_03.png" alt="Viewing changes 3" class="vscode-img" />

        <div class="row">
          <div class="single-col">
            <p>
              Now, all we need to do is to change the <span class="inline-code">diff</span> part of our command with
              <span class="inline-code">difftool</span> and select <span class="inline-code">Y</span> when prompted by
              Git Bash. This will open VS Code with both versions of our file placed side by side. The old copy that we
              have in the staging area is shown on the left-hand side panel, and the new copy that we have in the
              working directory is shown on the right-hand side panel.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="single-col">
            <div class="center">
              <img src="viewing_changes_04.png" alt="Viewing changes 4" class="vscode-img" />
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="single-col">
            <p>
              Now we can take a look at the diffs in the staging area by running
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git difftool --staged</code>
            </div>
            <p>
              In this case, the old copy (left) is what we had on the last commit, and the new copy (right) is what we
              have on the staging area. If more than one file is affected then, once we are done with the first one and
              close VS Code, Git Bash will ask us if we want to look at the other one.
