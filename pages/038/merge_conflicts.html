              When merging branches, three different types of conflicts may arise
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The same line of code was changed in different ways in the two merging branches.
              </li>
              <li>
                A file was changed in one branch but deleted in the other branch.
              </li>
              <li>
                The same file is added in different branches, but the content of the file is different in the two
                branches.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Whenever there's a conflict Git will not know how to merge the branches and it's going to ask us to solve
              the conflicts manually before staging and committing the merge.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="example"></div>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="left-col">
            <p>
              To see an example of the first scenario, let's create a new branch called
              <span class="git-aqua">bugfix</span> and change the <em>toc.txt</em> file. In this file, we'll delete all
              its content and on the first line write <em>Changes from bugfix branch</em>. Now stage it and commit it.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Next, we'll switch back to <span class="git-aqua">master</span>. Open the <em>toc.txt</em> file. Delete
              all its content, and in the first row write <em>Changes from master branch</em>. Stage it. Commit it.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>Now we'll run</p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git merge bugfix</code>
            </div>
            <p>
              Now Git is telling us that there is a conflict and that the automatic merge process failed. Notice that
              Git Bash has changed from <span class="git-aqua">master</span> to
              <span class="git-aqua">master|MERGING</span>. This tells us that Git is in the middle of a merge process.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="right-col">
            <img src="merge_conflicts_01.png" alt="Merge conflicts 1" class="git-bash-img" />
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="left-col">
            <img src="merge_conflicts_02.png" alt="Merge conflicts 2" class="git-bash-img" />
          </div>
          <div class="right-col">
            <p>First, let's run</p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git status</code>
            </div>
            <p>
              Here we can see where the merge conflict is under the unmerged paths. Git is telling us that both branches
              have changes to <em>toc.txt</em>. So let's open <em>toc.txt</em> in VS Code by running
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>code toc.txt</code>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="left-col">
            <p>
              The image to the right is what you'll see in VS Code. What we see are markers that represent the changes
              in the current branch (green) and the changes in the other branch (blue). In between them there's a
              divider marked by equal signs, <em>=======</em>. This syntax will be repeated throughout the file as many
              times as there are conflicts.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="right-col">
            <img src="merge_conflicts_03.png" alt="Merge conflicts 3" class="vscode-img" id="vscode-merge-conflict" />
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="left-col">
            <img src="merge_conflicts_04.png" alt="Merge conflicts 4" class="vscode-img" />
          </div>
          <div class="right-col">
            <p>
              On top of the <span class="git-green">HEAD</span> marker, there are three buttons. We need to choose one.
              If we select <em>Accept Current Change</em> then the changes from the current branch will be kept and the
              incoming ones will be discarded. If the select <em>Accept Incoming Changes</em> the incoming changes will
              be kept and the current ones will be discarded. If we select <em>Accept Both Changes</em> then both
              changes will be kept, in the order in which VS Code is showing them.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              For this demo, I'll go with <em>Accept Both Changes</em> and the file will change to what you see on the
              image to the left.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="single-col">
            <p>
              Three brief comments before we move on. There's a fourth button that reads <em>Compare Changes</em>. If
              you click on it, VS Code will open the file in diff mode (that is, showing the changes side by side).
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              If you selected an option and wish to change it, even if you have already saved it, just press Ctrl + z
              (undo). Git will not continue with the merge process until we manually create a merge commit.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              You can always edit the file by hand. To do so, you'll need to remove the markers and the separation. Try
              not to include new changes on the merge commit (that is, new code or new lines of any sort). But sometimes
              this is not possible because of the kind of merge conflict that we are faced with. We refer to merge
              commits that add new code as <em>evil commits</em>.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="left-col">
            <p>
              Now that we have resolved all merge conflicts, we can stage our changes with
              <span class="inline-code">git add toc.txt</span>. If we run
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git status</code>
            </div>
            <p>
              we'll see that now there are no more unmerged paths. Therefore, there are no more changes. At this point,
              we can commit our changes. Since this is a merge commit, we will not introduce a commit message. So we run
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git commit</code>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="right-col">
            <img src="merge_conflicts_05.png" alt="Merge conflicts 5" class="git-bash-img" />
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="single-col">
            <p>
              Because we didn't provide a commit message, Git will open VS Code. In general, we accept the default
              short-message but add a description explaining how the merge conflicts were resolved. Once done, we save
              our changes and close VS Code. Now Git will complete the merge process. You can see that Git Bash has
              changed from <span class="git-aqua">master|MERGING</span> to <span class="git-aqua">master</span>.
