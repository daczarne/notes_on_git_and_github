              Suppose we are working on a new feature and we realize that we
              forgot to create a new branch before starting. We could throw away
              our work and create a new branch. But that would
              involve...well...throwing away our work. We can solve this
              situation by <em>stashing</em> our work.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              As an example, suppose we created the new <em>calc.py</em> on
              <span class="git-aqua">master</span> and now we want to move it
              into a new branch called
              <span class="git-aqua">calc-functions</span>. First we need to
              stash our un-tracked file. To so we run
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git stash push -u -m "calc functions"</code>
            </div>
            <p>
              We use the <span class="inline-code">-u</span> option here because
              our file was un-tracked. More on that below. Now that we've stash
              our changes, we can switch into a new branch with
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git switch -C "calc-functions"</code>
            </div>
            <p>
              This will create a new branch called
              <span class="git-aqua">calc-functions</span> and the
              <span class="inline-code">-C</span> option with tell Git to also
              <span class="inline-code">switch</span> into it. Now that we are
              in the new branch, we can unpack our stashed changes by running
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git stash pop</code>
            </div>
            <p>We can now finish our work, stage it and commit it.</p>

                    When we invoke
                    <span class="inline-code">git stash</span> Git commits our
                    changes and creates a new type of reference called a
                    <em>stash</em> from where it can access that new commit
                    (technically there are several commits involved depending on
                    what we are stashing, you can read all about it

                  <p>
                    When we switch branches Git just moves the
                    <em>HEAD</em> reference to the tip of that branch.

                    Finally, when we <span class="inline-code">pop</span> our
                    stashed commit, Git adds the content of that commit to the
                    working directory in that branch.

              One thing to keep in mind here is the difference between
              <span class="inline-code">git stash pop</span> and
              <span class="inline-code">git stash apply</span>. They both add
              the content of the stash to the working directory of that branch,
              but while <span class="inline-code">pop</span> deletes the stash,
              <span class="inline-code">apply</span> does not.
            </p>

          <div class="left-col">
            <p>
              We can have more than one stash. To get the list of stashes we run
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git stash list</code>
            </div>
            <p>
              Git keeps track of which stash was added first and which one was
              added last. The stash at the top of the list is the one that was
              added last. When we run
              <span class="inline-code">git stash apply</span> (or
              <span class="inline-code">pop</span>) this is the stash that will
              be applied by default. But each stash has a unique identifier
              called <em>stash@{n}</em> where <em>n</em> is its position on the
              stash stack. You can use these identifiers (or just the
              <em>n</em> number) to reference them when popping or applying.

              One place in which this references come in handy is when viewing
              the changes of a stash. When we have more than one stash we should
              check what's in a stash before applying in to the working
              directory. To do this we run
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git stash show <em>n</em></code>
            </div>
            <p>
              where <span class="inline-code">n</span> is the reference. With
              this Git will show us what changes are done in each stash so that
              we can choose which one we want to apply.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>Once we select the stash to apply, we can do so with</p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git stash apply <em>n</em></code>
            </div>
            <p>
              Once we are done with our stashes we should delete them. Here we
              can use
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git stash drop <em>n</em></code>
            </div>
            <p>to drop the n-th stash, or</p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git stash clear</code>
            </div>
            <p>to drop all stashes.</p>
