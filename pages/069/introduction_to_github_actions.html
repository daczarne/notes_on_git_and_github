              GitHub Actions is a tool that allows you to automate development workflows. Each task is called an
              <em>action</em>. A combination of tasks is called a <em>workflow</em>. Workflows can be triggered in
              different ways: push, pull requests (opened and/or merged), issues (created, closed, etc), on a specific
              schedule, or due to external events.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The workflows will be run in a virtual machine on the GitHub servers. A workflow can contain one or more
              <em>jobs</em>, and each job will run in its own virtual machine. These virtual machines can use Linux,
              Windows, or MacOS, and have different tools installed, and even run Docker Containers. Jobs can be run
              in parallel, or we can specify dependencies between them.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              A <em>runner</em> is any virtual machine with the GitHub actions application installed. The runner is
              responsible for running the job whenever the triggering conditions are met, and for displaying back the
              results. You can use GitHub's runners, or host your own ones. GitHub hosted runners are maintained by
              GitHub, but we cannot customize the hardware configurations. They also come with some pre-installed tools
              like <i>curl</i>, <i>git</i>, <i>npm</i>, <i>yarn</i>, <i>pip</i>, etc, and languages and tools like
              Python, Ruby, node.JS, etc.
            </p>

            <p>
              Workflows must be written in YAML and placed inside <em>.github/workflows</em> directory in the root of
              the project. This files are composed of key:value pairs, with keys separated from values by colons,
              <em>:</em>. To nest objects inside of other objects in YAML we just need to indent the keys of the child
              object with 2 or 4 spaces with respect to the keys of its parent object.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Each YAML file in the <em>workflows</em> directory contains the instructions for one workflow. The first
              key that we have to specify is <em>name</em>. The value we pass to it will become the name of the workflow
              and GitHub will display it in the Actions tab.
            </p>

          <div class="right-col">
            <p>
              After the <em>name</em> we'll specify the dispatch mode of the action using the <em>on</em> key. The value
              of the <em>on</em> key can be a single value (for example, use <em>push</em> for a workflow that needs to
              be dispatched with every push), an array of values (for example, use <em>[workflow_dispatch, push]</em>
              for a workflow that needs to be dispatched with every push, but also needs to be able to be manually
              dispatched), or an object specifying more complex conditions or to alter the behavior of a pre-defined
              dispatch mode.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              After the <em>name</em> and <em>on</em> keys, we need to start defining the jobs in our workflow. To do so
              we use the <em>jobs</em> key. To it we'll need to supply an array of objects (each element in the array
              representing a job) where the first key is the name of the job and takes as its value an object containing
              all the specifications of the job.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The first key of every job is <em>runs-on</em>. The value of this key needs to be the operating system in
              which the job is going to run. We can specify a version of the OS, or just use the key
              <em>{os}-latest</em> to have GitHub use the latest version of the OS.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Next comes the <em>steps</em> key, where we can specify the different steps of the job. We can specify a
              name for each step using the <em>name</em> key. After that we use the <em>run</em> key to specify what
              needs to be run on this step.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="single-col">
            <p>
              The first and last step are automatically created by GitHub. The first one sets up the job, and the last
              one cleans up after finishing. You can configure GitHub to send notifications after each workflow run by
              going to <i> Profile &gt Settings &gt Notifications &gt Actions </i>.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              We can cancel a workflow while it's still running by pressing the <i>Cancel check suite</i> button on the
              top right corner of the <i>Actions</i> tab. We can also explore the steps, including their output, buy
              pressing the arrows left of the step name. We can use the search bar to explore the logs. If the job
              failed, we can trigger a re-run.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              For each job we can define <em>artifacts</em>. In a nut shell, an artifact is a file generated by the job.
              An artifact that gets generated by default is the log archive. We can download this file from the Actions
              console. The log consists of one <i>.txt</i> file for each step of the job. It is useful for debugging.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              To see more information on the logs, we need to set the <em>ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG</em> and
              <em>ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG</em> secrets to <em>true</em>. To do so, we need to navigate to the <i>Settings</i>
              tab on the repo, and to the <i>Secrets</i> option on the left side menu, and click on the <i> New
                repository secret </i> button on the top right corner.
