              Now we have a snapshot in the <em>Staging Area</em> that is ready to be permanently saved in the
              <em>Repository</em>. To do this we run
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git commit -m "Commit Message"</code>
            </div>
            <p>
              Here the <span class="inline-code">-m</span> flag means that we are providing a message. The message
              itself is what we type in quotes. This will only let us write a short one-line message. If we need longer
              messages we omit the flag, and Git will open our text editor, where we can enter a more detailed message.
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git commit</code>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="left-col">
            <img
              src="committing_changes_01.png"
              alt="Committing changes 1"
              class="vscode-img"
              id="committing-changes-1"

          <div class="right-col">
            <p>
              Now on VS Code, we can write our <span class="inline-code">commit</span> message. On the first line, we
              should write the title of our commit or a short description of it. This description should not exceed 80
              characters.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Then we write a long description that explains what was changed, deleted, or added in this
              <span class="inline-code">commit</span>. When done, we save the changes and close VS Code. Keep in mind
              that when we close VS Code the <span class="inline-code">commit</span> command is executed, so make sure
              to double-check your message and make sure you included everything that needs to be included.
            </p>

              Back in Git Bash, we'll see a message with basic statistics of what was changed. Here it says that two
              files were changed: <em>file1.txt</em> and <em>file2.txt</em>. It also says that there were three
              insertions (one for each time we added <em>hello</em> to each file and one for when we added
              <em>world</em> to <em>file1.txt</em>).
