              Because syncing up the local and remote repositories is so common, Git has a special command that will
              <span class="inline-code">git fetch</span> and <span class="inline-code">git merge origin/master</span> in
              one go
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git pull</code>
            </div>
            <br />
            <p>
              To see an example of this, I've created a new commit on GitHub. Now we run
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git pull</code>
            </div>
            <p>
              In the Git Bash image, you can see how Git first fetched the updates and then automatically performed a
              merge (fast-forward merge in this case).

              Since you will probably be working on teams, most of the time updating your local repository will not be
              so straightforward since while you were making commits on your local repository, other team members were
              making commits on their local repositories. Once done, you'll send your changes to the remote (an action
              called <span class="inline-code">pushing</span> which we'll cover next). But what happens if your local
              <span class="git-green">main</span> branch and the remote <span class="git-green">main</span> branch have
              diverge?
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Because updating the local repository involves fetching the origin and merging, the situations you may
              encounter are the same as when you merge two local branches: either 1) the other person changed some file
              which does not affect the files you are changing, or 2) you both updated the same file and you'll have to
              resolve a merger conflict when pulling.
            </p>

          <div class="right-col">
            <p>
              Let's see an example of the first situation: you changed some files in your local repository that have not
              been changed in the remote repository. To do this, first we go back to GitHub and write yet another line
              in the <em>README.md</em> file. Then we create a new local file and commit it. Finally, we
              <span class="inline-code">git pull</span>.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Because our local and remote <span class="git-green">main</span> branches had diverged, Git used a
              three-way merge and created a merge commit.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="left-col">
            <p>
              Because this creates a non-linear history, some people prefer using a
              <span class="inline-code">git pull --rebase</span>. To see this, first we need to undo the merge commit.
              Then we run
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git pull --rebase</code>
            </div>
            <p>Now we have a linear history, and there is no merge commit.</p>
