              Now suppose we want to amend a previous commit. To do this we need
              to use <em>interactive rebasing</em>. Remember that with rebasing
              we can replay a bunch of commits on top of other commits. The
              interactive part of the name means that we want to give Git
              instructions while doing it.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              As an example, suppose we want to amend commit <em>8441b05</em>.
              To do so, we need to supply its parent commit to Git. That is
              <em>8527033</em>. So we run
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git rebase -i 8527033</code>
            </div>

            <p>
              Git will open VS Code in a script that looks like the one below.
              In this script we can tell Git which operation we want to do for
              each commit. If you are using the GitLens extension then commits
              will appear in the same order as they would when running
              <span class="inline-code">git log</span>. So at the top you'll see
              the latest commit and at the bottom the commit we want to edit.
              Otherwise, at the top you'll see the commit that we want to edit
              and, at the bottom, the latest commit in this branch.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              For each commit you can give an instruction. For this demo, we'll
              just edit one commit. So, we select the edit option from the
              dropdown menu.
            </p>

            <img src="amending_earlier_commits_02.png" alt="Amending earlier commits 2" class="vscode-img" />

            <p>
              When we close the VS Code window (or click on
              <em>Start Rebase</em> if you are using GitLens) the rebase
              operation will start.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Because we told Git that we wanted to edit commit
              <em>8441b05</em>, Git stopped at that commit so that we can make
              our changes. We can amend this commit now.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              In this case, we are just making changes to one file, but we could
              add or delete files if we needed to. When we are done, we stage
              our changes and commit them by running
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git commit --amend</code>
            </div>
            <p>just as we would if we were amending the last commit.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="right-col">
            <img src="amending_earlier_commits_03.png" alt="Amending earlier commits 3" class="git-bash-img" />

        <div class="row">

            <img src="amending_earlier_commits_04.png" alt="Amending earlier commits 4" class="git-bash-img" />

          <div class="right-col">
            <p>
              If we take a look at the log, we see that we now have two
              branches. One with all the old commits that we are now rebasing
              (at its tip you can see the
              <span class="git-aqua">master</span> pointer). The other branch is
              the one that we are creating with the interactive rebase.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Because we told Git that we wanted to edit this commit, the
              rebasing operation is waiting for us to tell it to continue. When
              we do, Git will replay all the other commits involved in the
              rebase on top of the new commit.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>To continue with the rebase, we run</p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git rebase --continue</code>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="left-col">
            <p>
              Since at the start of the rebase we told Git that we only wanted
              to edit that one commit, when we run continue, Git automatically
              took care of the other commits.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Once done rebasing all commits, Git moved the pointer of our
              branch (in this case <span class="git-aqua">master</span>) to the
              tip of the new branch.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="right-col">
            <img src="amending_earlier_commits_05.png" alt="Amending earlier commits 5" class="git-bash-img" />
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="single-col">
            <p>
              If at any pause during the rebase operation you decide that you
              don't want to go through with it, you can run
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git rebase --abort</code>
            </div>
            <p>
              and Git will restore everything to the state before starting the
              rebase.
