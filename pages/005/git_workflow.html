              When working with Git the normal workflow starts with making changes to files, or adding new files, or
              deleting old files that are no longer needed. Once we are done making changes, we
              <span class="inline-code">add</span> these files to the <em>Staging Area</em>. If we are satisfied with
              the changes, we will <span class="inline-code">commit</span> those changes to the <em>Repository</em>.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Creating a <span class="inline-code">commit</span> is like taking a snapshot of our project. These
              snapshots are permanently stored in our repository. If there are changes that we don't want to add to the
              snapshot, we can un-stage them and add them to a later snapshot.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>To add a file to the staging area we use</p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git add <em>file_name.ext</em></code>
            </div>
            <p>
              Once we've reviewed the files and are sure that we want to take a snapshot, we use
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git commit -m <em>"commit message"</em></code>
            </div>
            <p>
              Every <span class="inline-code">commit</span> should contain a meaningful message that explains what
              changes were made in that snapshot.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="single-col center">
            <img
              src="git_workflow_01.png"
              alt="Git workflow 1"
              class="miro-img"
              id="git-workflow-1"
            />
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="single-col">
            <p>
              Once we <span class="inline-code">commit</span> some changes the <em>Staging Area</em> does not get
              emptied. Think of it as the staging server of an application. Once we release a new version, the live and
              staging versions are the same, but that does not mean that there is no staging version.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              If we make some new changes to a file, we need to <span class="inline-code">stage</span> the files again.
              The same is true when deleting files. If we delete a file from our working directory, we need to
              <span class="inline-code">stage</span> the deletion. To do it we use
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git add <em>name_of_the_deleted_file</em></code>
            </div>
            <p>
              Then we can permanently record this deletion by committing it with the following command:
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git commit -m <em>"commit message"</em></code>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="single-col">
            <p>Each <span class="inline-code">commit</span> contains:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A unique ID that gets generated by Git</li>
              <li>The <span class="inline-code">commit</span> message</li>
              <li>Date and time of the commit</li>
              <li>Author</li>
              <li>
                A complete snapshot of the project at the time the <span class="inline-code">commit</span> was created
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Git can store the complete project snapshot because it compresses the files and doesn't store duplicates.
