              Now suppose that we want to drop commit <em>1736531</em>. To do
              this, we'll use interactive rebasing. As always, we should start
              our rebase process with the parent of that commit.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              If we take a look at the content of that commit, we see that in
              that commit we introduced a new file called <em>terms.txt</em>.
              When we drop this commit we have two possible scenarios that we
              need to be careful of. If a commit after that one touches that
              file, and we drop the commit where the file was introduced, then
              we will get a conflict when the rebasing operation reaches that
              point in which the file is edited and we will have to resolve it.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The worst-case scenario is when no other commits touch that file,
              but our program needs it. In this case, we will never get a
              conflict while rebasing, but we will be introducing a bug in our
              program (possibly even a breaking bug). So be very careful when
              dropping commits.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>To start the interactive rebase process we run</p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git rebase -i 1736531^</code>
            </div>
            <p>
              The caret (^) means that we want to start at the parent of that
              commit.

              Git will now open VS Code so that we can select the operation that
              we want to perform on each commit. Here we select the
              <em>drop</em> option for the commit that we want to drop. If you
              are now using GitLens, you can also just delete the line for that
              commit. Once we selected all the appropriate options for our
              commits, we save the file and close it. Here let's start by
              deleting the first WIP commit.

              When we close the file, Git will move forward with the rebase
              operation. Take a look at the Git Bash image. It's telling us that
              we are at step 2 of 5 during the rebase process. So the commit
              that we wanted to drop has been dropped. The next commit edited
              that file, which now does not exist, so we get a conflict.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              If we check the status, we can see that the
              <em>terms.txt</em> file is been deleted (hence the red
              <span class="git-red">D</span>) and modified (hence the red
              <span class="git-red">U</span>) at the same time. This is what's
              creating the conflict.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="left-col">
            <p>To solve this conflict we will use the mergetool. So we run</p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git mergetool</code>
            </div>
            <p>
              Because I haven't configured a merge tool, Git will use one of the
              default ones. Git is now asking to choose between one of the two
              states of the file. In the local commit (the one we are moving out
              of) the file is deleted. In the remote commit (the one we are
              trying to move into) the file is modified. Here we choose to keep
              the file with the modifications, so we select
              <span class="inline-code">m</span>.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              If we now check the status, we see that the
              <em>terms.txt</em> file is been added (since it was deleted in the
              previous commit). Notice that there's a new file called
              <em>terms.txt.orig</em>. This is a file created by the merge tool.
              Some delete them automatically, but even if the merge tool we are
              using does not, we can always do so ourselves.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>Since all conflicts have been resolved, when we run</p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git rebase --continue</code>
            </div>
            <p>Git takes care of rebasing all other involved commits.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="right-col">
            <p>
              If we check the log, we can see that the commit is now gone and we
              have a much cleaner history. Notice that I've also dropped the
              other WIP commit and the Revert commit too.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Lastly, since Git did not remove the auxiliary file created by the
              mergetool, we delete it ourselves.
