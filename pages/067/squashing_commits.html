              Now let's see how we can squash commits. Squashing commits is the
              process of taking two or more commits, and combining all the
              changes in those commits into a single commit. For example, here
              we will squash commits <em>78af47a</em>, <em>7f4e64b</em>, and
              <em>2a57b17</em> into a single commit. To do this, we use
              interactive rebasing. So we run
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git rebase -i ab0e842</code>
            </div>
            <p>
              where commit <em>ab0e842</em> is the parent of the oldest commit
              that we wish to squash.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="right-col">
            <img
              src="squashing_commits_01.png"
              alt="Squashing commits 1"
              class="git-bash-img"
            />
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="single-col">
            <p>
              To squash two commits together we need to use the
              <em>squash</em> option in VS Code. Notice how GitLens is not
              showing us which commits will be squashed into which commit by
              simplifying the commit tree. One thing to remember here is that
              squashing is an operation that can only be performed between two
              consecutive commits. So once the rebasing starts, Git will first
              squash commit <em>7f4e64b</em> into commit <em>78af47a</em>, and
              then squash commit <em>2a57b17</em> into the new commit that it
              created for the first squashing. If we want to squash commits that
              are not consecutive to one another, then we first need to reorder
              the commits.

              src="squashing_commits_02.png"
              alt="Squashing commits 2"
              class="vscode-img"
            />

              class="git-bash-img"
            />
          </div>
          <div class="right-col">
            <p>
              When we close VS Code and the rebasing starts, Git will ask us to
              give the new commit a message. The default message that it will
              show is the combination of the commit messages for all the commits
              that we are squashing. In general, since we squash commits that
              have changes that we should have made into a single commit to
              begin with, we should input a new message that reflects the
              changes done across all of the commits been squashed.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Now if we look at our log there is only one commit for all three
              sets of changes.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="left-col">
            <p>
              If we already know that the message for our squashed commit is the
              message for the oldest commit, then we can use the
              <em>fixup</em> option instead of the <em>squash</em> option. To
              see this in action, first we need to reset our repository to how
              it was before the last rebasing. So we bring up our reflog by
              running
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git reflog</code>
            </div>
            <p>
              and grab the commit ID to which the
              <span class="git-aqua">HEAD</span> pointer was pointing, before
              starting the rebase. In this case, commit <em>d038481</em> (which
              is the finish of the last rebase we did).
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="right-col">
            <img
              src="squashing_commits_04.png"
              alt="Squashing commits 4"
              class="git-bash-img"
            />
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="left-col">

              src="squashing_commits_05.png"
              alt="Squashing commits 5"
              class="git-bash-img"
            />
          </div>
          <div class="right-col">
            <p>Now we use</p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>git reset --hard d038481</code>
            </div>
            <p>
              and our repository will be restored to the state before the last
              rebase. We can see this in our log.

              Now we restart the interactive rebase just as before, but when Git
              asks us which operation to perform to the commits to squash, we
              choose <em>fixup</em>. This will cause Git to ignore the commit
              messages from these commits, and thus default to the commit that
              they are being squashed into (the one with the
              <em>pick</em> operation).

              Since there are no conflicts for us to resolve, as soon as we save
              and close the file, Git will complete the rebasing process. If we
              now check the log, we can see that the commits have been squashed,
              and the message of the oldest commit was kept without us having to
              tell Git which message to use.
